# Heart Disease Classification

This is a codebase for a small heart disease classification project undertaken for a graduate class EN.625.740.81.FA17 Data Mining.

The data source is from the UCI respository, available here:

My primary interest with this project is to experimentally explore the importance of selecting appropriate features, unlearnt model parameters and other unlearnt stuff.
